# Project Proposal
  My final project would be the c++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life for more information). A basic implementation would be generating a randomized initial state and let the player witness what will happen under the rules.

  Besides the basic implementation, I also plan to add some pre-computed patterns that have some "magical" effects under the rules of game of life, for example patterns that automatically move ("spaceships") and patterns that switch between several states ("oscillators").

  If I have decent programming skills I would also add features allowing the player to draw patterns by themselves.
  
  Library I am using for this project is ofxDatGui, so that I can improve the gui.
